        <p>
            <strong>Web development</strong> is the work involved in developing a website for the 
            <a href="#">Internet</a> (<ins>World Wide Web</ins>) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a 
            <i>simple single static page of plain text</i> to complex <a href="#">web applications</a>, 
            electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include 
            <a href="#">Web engineering</a>, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, 
            <mark>client-side/server-side scripting</mark>, <del>Web server and network security configuration</del>, and 
            <a href="#">e-commerce development</a>.

        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>
        
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the 
            <em>automated information-sharing needs</em> of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. 
            Consequently, <a href="#">HTML</a> was developed in 1993. Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a 
            <del>small amount</del> of information. Core protocols of web 1.0 were <b>HTTP</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <a href="#">URI</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 2.0 marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing <strong>interactivity</strong>. Web 2.0 introduced 
            <ins>increased user engagement and communication</ins>. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 
            and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, 
            <mark>read-write online network</mark>. In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages 
            sharing activities such as <i>creating music, files, images, and movies</i>. The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the 
            "backbone of the internet," using standardized <a href="#">XML</a> tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, considered the <b>third and current version</b> of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a 
            <em>complete redesign</em> of the web. Key features include the integration of <a href="#">metadata</a>, precise information delivery, 
            and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests. Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, 
            <ins>organized database</ins>, providing more functionality than traditional search engines. This version is sometimes also known as the 
            <a href="#">Semantic Web</a>.
